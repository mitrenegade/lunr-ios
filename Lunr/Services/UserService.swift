Listened to my concerns and provided reassurance, answered questions. Scheduled conveniently. Two plumbers worked well together to accomplish all of the work in one day. Neat and clean, left the work area the same way that it was found."),
            Review(rating: 4.0, text: "It was an excellent experience from start to finish. I called Duke's in the morning, and Duke answered the phone. He came early that evening to assess the job. It was agreed that he would send two plumbers the next morning, including his 'drain man', at 8:30. The two men arrived and worked for 4 + hours getting all the jobs completed. They were congenial and professional, and fixed and explained everything to my satisfaction. It is a great relief to have these jobs completed."),
            Review(rating: 3.3, text: "Provided service earlier than expected. Arrived and did an excellent job. Crew was funny and polite. Even capped a leaky side sprayer on kitchen sink for no charge."),
            Review(rating: 4.5, text: "Called Generation 3 Electric due to an emergency situation. This is my first time using this company. Spoke with Cindy who was very sympathetic and helpful - she had someone at my place in less than an hour and a half to review the situation."),
            Review(rating: 3.3, text: "Would absolutely hire again - they were on time, professional, and fast."),
            Review(rating: 4.5, text: "I was extremely pleased with the work that was done by Mariano and his partner Lee. They basically worked miracles in reconstructing one of my walls as well as a staircase railing in order to hang a newly purchased interior door. There was no door in this location before. It separates the master bedroom from my 2nd floor hallway. The workmanship was extremely skilled and professional."),
            Review(rating: 1, text: "I called these people and left a message that I needed their help with a rather urgent project. I received no call back and waited foolishly for 3 days to post this review. Do not count on these people for anything as they don't even give the courtesy of a call back."),
            Review(rating: 1.0, text: "Horrible, had to request my money back due to only one worker showing up and the other working driving away. The worker that did show up did not speak any English."),
            Review(rating: 4, text: "They arrived on time, brought in tarps and plastic sheets to enclose the area they would be working.began work right away. They completed all the work they said they would in the time frame I purchased and left the house clean. the work is well done. I am very pleased.")
